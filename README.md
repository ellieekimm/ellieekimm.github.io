# typingAccuracy
This JavaScript code provides a typing speed and accuracy test application. The application measures the user's typing speed and accuracy by comparing the input text with a randomly generated text retrieved from the "Bacon Ipsum" API.

## Features

1) Displays a random passage generated from the "Bacon Ipsum" API.  
2) Allows users to start the typing test by clicking the "Start!" button.  
3) Provides real-time feedback on the user's typing accuracy and speed.  
4) Highlights correctly typed characters in green and incorrectly typed characters in red.  
5) Plays an alert sound when the user types a character incorrectly.  
6) Calculates and displays the user's typing speed in words per minute (WPM) and accuracy percentage after completing the typing test.  
7) Resets the test and generates a new random passage when the "Start!" button is clicked again.
